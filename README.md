# discord-worker
Small library that connects to the rabbitmq message queue and the mongodb cache + command framework  
  
Many concepts and sometimes even complete code snippets are taken from [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). 
Credits go to Danny and all other contributors.  
  
This is not made with selfhosting in mind. You need some knowledge of python, the discord api, rabbitmq and mongodb to make this work.
I don't give any support for this.
